# discord_chatbot_ai
A selfbot for Discord that picks up speech patterns and uses them to send messages in servers and to chat with users.

# How Does The Bot Seem Human?
- Random delays for when the bot starts typing
- If a stored speech pattern has similarities with the parsed message sent by a user, respond with that speech pattern
- Random delays between sending messages
- Randomly tagging a user
- Filtering out spam and user set words
